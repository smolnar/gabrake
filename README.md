# Gabrake &mdash; Realtime Error Tracking with Google Analytics

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/smolnar/gabrake.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/smolnar/gabrake)

Gabrake is a gem built on top of Google Analytics API and provides realtime server-side and client-side error tracking by using custom events. It uses a flexibility of Google Analytics API and handles server-side error server-side, without exposing any of your error messages or backtrace on client.

Let's have a look.

Inspired by [garelic](https://github.com/jsuchal/garelic) &mdash; gem that tracks app performace by Google Analytics User Timing variables.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'gabrake'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install gabrake

## Usage

### 1. Set it up

Create an initializer `config/initializers/gabrake.rb` and add

```ruby
Gabrake.tracking_id = 'YOUR GA TRACKING ID'
```

In your javascript do

```coffeecript
#= require gabrake/analytics # if you haven't required analytics tracking code somewhere else
#= require gabrake
```

**Note**: *This library uses new analytics.js code &ndash; Universal Google Analytics. If you still have the old `_gaq` library and you use it (for tracking events and stuff), you have to [create a new property](http://stackoverflow.com/a/20690546/1691413) (get second tracking ID and use that one for Gabrake).*

### 2. Track errors

Go to Google Analytics page, hit **Real Time** > **Events** and track 'em.

**Pro Tip:** *Gabrake errors have two categories &ndash; Gabrake (Rails) and Gabrake (JavaScript). Click on one of the category to filter out events and see error message (action) along with error backtrace location (label).*

### 3. Analyze

Wait couple minutes.

1. Go to **Behaviour** > **Events** > **Overview**. 
2. Click on one of the Gabrake categories. On top of table, choose primary dimension as **Event Action**. 
3. Choose secondary dimension by your taste &mdash; *Event Label (backtrace location), Page, Browser.*

**Important**: *Make sure that the overview date includes TODAY! You'll save yourself a headache.*

## Advanced

### Tracking versions

If you want to compare errors by app versions, you need create a custom dimension. 

1. Go to **Admin** > Under **Property** tab (the big middle one) > hit **Custom Definitions** > **Custom Dimension** > create one.
2. Write down the name and the index. 
3. Set `Gabrake.custom_dimension_index = YOUR_INDEX`.
3. Go to **Behaviour** > **Events** > **Overview**. Click category. Choose **Event Action**. Search for secondary dimension, by the name. Choose it.
